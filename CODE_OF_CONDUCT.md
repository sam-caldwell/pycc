# Code of Conduct

This project follows a community Code of Conduct to help create a welcoming, harassment‑free environment for everyone.

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment‑free 
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity
and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, 
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information (such as a physical or email address) without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take 
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews, 
documentation, demos) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported in the following ways:
- Open a GitHub issue describing the concern. If privacy is required, mark it clearly and avoid including sensitive 
  details.
- If a private report is preferred, contact the maintainers via the contact information in their GitHub profiles or the
  repository README. If none is available, open a minimal issue requesting a private channel.

Maintainers will review and investigate all complaints promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to 
respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines to determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation 
of this Code of Conduct:

1) Correction
  - Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome but believed to be 
     unintentional.

     the behavior was inappropriate.
2) Warning
  - Impact: A single incident or series of actions that violate the Code of Conduct.

  - Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication within the community for a 
    specified period of time.
